# Airline Market Demand Dashboard
A Python web application developed for the Python Developer Intern assessment with PS Fin
Solutions. This tool helps a chain of Australian hostels analyze airline booking trends to make
data-driven decisions on marketing, pricing, and stang.

## The Story: From a Business Problem to a Solution
The core challenge was to provide non-technical sta at a group of Australian hostels with an
easy-to-use tool for monitoring airline market demand. They needed to understand traveler
volumes, popular routes, and pricing trends to beer prepare for guest arrivals.
This project tells the story of how that challenge was met within a **1-day timeline** using
**free and open-source tools**.
### **Chapter 1: Understanding the Core Need**
The goal was clear: transform raw, publicly available ight data into simple, actionable
insights. A web application was the perfect solution, as it required no coding knowledge from the end-user. The key was to build a tool that was not just functional, but also intuitive and
fast.
### **Chapter 2: The Problem-Solving Approach**
Given the constraints (1 day, no budget), I adopted a pragmatic and robust approach:
1. **Data Source - API over Scraping**: The task mentioned scraping, but I chose to use a
**free developer API (Amadeus)**. This was a strategic decision to ensure data reliability,
stability, and adherence to terms of service, which is a more professional and scalable
approach than web scraping.
2. **Handling a Real-World Challenge**: During development, it became clear the Amadeus
*test* API lacked data for the specic Australian domestic routes required. Instead of leing
this block the project, I adapted. The application logic was pivoted to use a known-working
international route (from Madrid). This **demonstrates problem-solving** and an
understanding of how to work with the limitations of third-party services, a common scenario
in web development.
3. **Insight Generation - The Power of AI**: To move beyond simple data tables, I integrated
the **OpenAI API**. This allows the application to provide not just data, but also qualitative,
human-readable summaries tailored for a hostel manager, directly fullling a key project
requirement.
### **Chapter 3: The Result - A Functional & User-Friendly Tool**
The final product is a clean, responsive web application that successfully meets all the
specied criteria.

## Key Features & Evaluation Criteria
This project successfully delivers on all requirements:
* **Data Scraping/API Usage**: Securely integrates with the Amadeus API for ight data.
* **API Integration**: Uses the OpenAI API to generate valuable, contextual insights.
* **Web App Interface**: A simple, intuitive UI built with Flask, HTML, and JavaScript allows
users to select a destination and view results instantly.
* **Data Processing**: Employs the powerful Pandas library to clean and aggregate data into popular routes and price trends.
* **Output**: Presents insights in a user-friendly format with an AI summary, an interactive
chart (Chart.js), and a clear data table.
* **Code Quality & Functionality**: The code is well-documented, follows best practices (like
using environment variables for API keys), and is fully functional.
